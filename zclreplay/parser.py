        each build-square on the map. This index starts in the Top Left (GhostAcademy)
        at number 0 and increases by 1 each square to the right and down each row.

        In our database, we refer to Player Positions. This is legacy in how
        we assigned them and how we track who is in what "lane".

        We use starting bunker positions to get the "Position" of a player.

        Relationships are hard work...
        In order to get Player Ids from the game, we have to dig through a
        couple different events. We cannot rely on lobby state or slot numbers.

        Compounding the problem, we have to jump through quite a bit of
        relationships to get the holy grail of a playerID that is found in all
        game_events.


        - To get player names  etc, we need to look at the "details" of the replay,
            specifically at m_playerList. The only credible id in this section is
            m_workingSetSlotId. This is a problem because every event in
            game_events is tracked by m_controlPlayerId. We need to find a
            relationship.

        - Player ID is found in "NNet.Replay.Tracker.SPlayerSetupEvent"
            inside of tracker_events. The only relationship avaiable is a
            USER ID field m_userId

        - User ID can be found in init_data and has the relationship to  m_slots

        Therefore:
            - Create a mapping of m_workingSetSlotId -> m_userID
            - Create a mapping of m_userID -> m_controlPlayerId

        We also create mappings to get database level "positions" of each spawn.
        This is an index so we know exactly where they are in case we want to
        build future relationships. See the pid_to_positions() function for more
